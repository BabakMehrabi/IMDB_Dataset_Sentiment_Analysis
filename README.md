# IMDB_Dataset_Sentiment_Analysis

In this project, a CNN model is built for the sentiment analysis of imdb-movie-review dataset. 
The notebook can be run on the kaggle platform, as the dataset is already available there. 

If it is run on kaggle, the dataset must be added to the path. If on a machine, the dataset could be downloaded from the following link: 

https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

In the latter case, proper change to the importing section of the code must be made.
