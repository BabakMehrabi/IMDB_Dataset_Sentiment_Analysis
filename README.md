# IMDB_Dataset_Sentiment_Analysis

The aim in this project is to conduct a sentiment analysis of imdb-movie-review dataset by two deep learning approaches: CNN and LSTM.
Sentiment analysis is a kind of text classification. 

There are two jupyter notebooks, to be run on the kaggle platform, as the dataset is already available there. 

If a notebook is run on kaggle, the dataset must be added to the path, which can easily be done on kaggle platform. If it is meant to be run on a local machine, the dataset could be downloaded from the following link: 

https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

In the latter case, proper change to the importing section of the code must be made.
